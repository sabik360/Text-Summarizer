Neural network models, based on the attentional encoder-decoder model, have good capability in abstractive text summarization.However, these models are hard to be controlled in the process of generation, which leads to a lack of key information. We propose a guiding generation model that combines the extractive method and the abstractive method.Firstly, we obtain keywords from the text by a extractive model. Then, we introduce a Key Information Guide Network (KIGN), which encodes the keywords to the key information representation, to guide the process of generation. In addition, we use a prediction-guide mechanism, which can obtain the long-term value for future decoding, to further guide the summary generation. We evaluate our model on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The experimental results show that our model leads to significant improvements.
 
A summary of an article is a shortened version containing key points in order to condense it into few points and to do so in words used in the article itself. With such a big amount of data circulating in the digital space, there is need to develop an efficient tool that can automatically reduce much of this text data to shorter, focused summaries that capture the salient details, both so we can navigate it more effectively as well as check whether the larger documents contain the information that we are looking for.
There are many reasons and uses for a summary of a larger document,from shortening a lengthy news article to simplifying a complicated study material, a text summarizer is an efficient and useful tool to all target audiences.Since manual text summarization is a time expensive and generally laborious task, especially when the number of documents is considerably high, the automatization of the task is gaining increasing popularity and therefore constitutes a strong motivation for this project. Unlike pre-existing methods, by combining BERT and TextRank algorithm we can achieve faster and efficient results.To summarize effectively, long and complex pieces of articles. NLP algorithms, namely BERT and TextRank, are going to be used in combination, for this project, to obtain better summarising capabilities and an extracting algorithm will be used to extract and display important keywords from the text document.
